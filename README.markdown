# Introduction

This is an example project showing how to use BDD frameworks with Maven.
At the moment I have examples for:

*   [Concordion](http://www.concordion.org/)
*   [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/)
*   [JBehave](http://jbehave.org/)
*   [Jnario](http://jnario.org/)
*   [Spock](https://code.google.com/p/spock/)
*   [Thucydides](http://thucydides.info/)

Note Thucydides did not work always correctly when build together with all other modules. But it can run on its own.
