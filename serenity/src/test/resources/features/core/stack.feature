Feature: Implementing a stack
  In order to develop an application that requires a stack efficiently
  As a development team
  I would like to use an interface and implementation in Java directly


  Scenario:  Basic functionality of a Stack

    Given an empty stack
    When the string Java is added
    And the string C++ is added
    And the last element is removed again
    Then the resulting element should be Java
